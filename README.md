Important Notes:
1. Make sure to test your code before pushing to Develop
2. NEVER merge or push to main from any other branch aside from Develop.
3. Make sure to always pull recent changes before working.
4. Make branches off of the Develop branch.
5. Make sure to give branches useful names. This also applies to commmit messages.
6. Once you are done with a branch i.e. the addition you wanted to make is finished and tested. Do NOT delete that branch.
